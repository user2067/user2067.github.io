        Confucianism is a significant part of Taiwan's Culture. It means a lot to many of the people that live there. One example is the idea that children should respect and obey their parents, teachers, and other elders. He says that if children weren't raised in this way, it would be equal to raising animals. Confucius said that they had much more experience in life compared to children so they always know what is best for them. This is a frequent idea accepted by Taiwanese parents as many of them often sign their children up for programs and encourage them to put all of their effort into academics because they believe that is right. They will often make sure they are in complete control of their child's life and they know everything going on. Often, they will enforce punishments upon children who disagree.

      <h2><b>Background information</b></h2>
      <p>
        In 1683, the Qing Dynasty took over control of Taiwan, which during that time was being inhabited mostly by Europeans and natives. Confucian ideas were present in the Qing Dynasty, so they made their way to Taiwan. In around 1911, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, but Confucian ideas and traditions stayed in Taiwan even after Chiang-kai Shek took over the Island of Taiwan.

      This image is a picture of a Confucian temple located in Tainan, Taiwan. It was built during the Qing dynasty in 1685 and served as a location dedicated for Confucian worship. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction, but Confucian ceremonies are still held there every year and the building still preserves many artifacts.
