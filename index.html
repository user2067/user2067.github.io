      <h2><b>Confucianism in Taiwan</b></h2>
      <p>
        Confucianism is a significant part of Taiwan's Culture. It means a lot to many of the people that live there. One example is the idea that children should respect and obey their parents, teachers, and other elders. Confucius said that they had much more experience in life compared to children so they always know what is best for them. This is a frequent idea accepted by Taiwanese parents as many of them often sign their children up for programs and encourage them to put all of their effort into academics because they believe that is right. Often, they will enforce punishments upon children who disagree.
